## @desc Provides support transforms for handling numbers.

# Note below that we put the ^ and $ for the Transform in at the Transform
# stage, otherwise the non-catching versions would have them too, and they'd
# match nothing in any context at all.

# Ordinalities - ordering numbers

Ordinality = LaserTransform OrdinalityRegexp do |type, ordinality|
  ## @name Ordinality
  ## @format (every|any|the (first|second|third|fourth|fifth|...|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|...))
  ## @desc Represents an ordinality - denoting position in a sequence. English words are supported up to "twentieth" - otherwise use the numeric form (unlimited). Note that a zero index <strong>is not</strong> possible - arrays of objects start at 'first', not 'zeroth'.

Cardinality = LaserTransform CardinalityRegexp do |cardinality|
  ## @name Cardinality
  ## @format (zero|a[n]|one|two|three|four|...|0|1|2|3|4|...)
  ## @desc Represents a cardinality - denoting a count of objects. English words are supported up to "twenty" and "a"/"an" - otherwise use the numeric form (unlimited). Note that a zero count <strong>is</strong> possible.
  next 1 if cardinality.downcase == "a" || cardinality.downcase == "an"

# Lengths of time - turns a string representing a time period into the number of seconds

TimeLengthRegexp = /(#{Cardinality})\ ?(s(?:econd)?|m(?:inute)?|h(?:our)?|d(?:ay)?|w(?:eek)?|month|year|decade)(?:s)?/xi

  ## @name TimeLength
  ## @format <<Cardinality>>[ ](s[econd]|m[inute]|h[our]|d[ay]|w[eek]|month|year|decade)[s]
  ## @desc Represents a length of time - currently supporting the above-mentioned timespans. Support for centuries, millenia, etc. was not included, as you cannot neatly add an 's' to get the plural form. Please note that the month, year and decade are all an average month, year and decade, correcting for leap years, but not leap seconds.
